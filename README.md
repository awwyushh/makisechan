# MakiseChan 💻✨

**An AI-Powered OS Kernel Optimizer**

MakiseChan is an intelligent kernel optimization system that dynamically adjusts OS parameters, optimizes scheduling, and enhances system performance using machine learning techniques. Inspired by Kurisu Makise from *Steins;Gate*, this project aims to make OS-level performance tuning as seamless and efficient as possible.

## 📜 To-Do List (Learning & Implementation Roadmap)

### **Phase 1: Understanding the Kernel (Learning Stage)**
1. 📖 Learn the basics of **Linux Kernel architecture**.
2. 📖 Study **kernel parameters** (sysctl, /proc, /sys interface).
3. 📖 Understand **process scheduling** (CFS, BFS, MuQSS, etc.).
4. 📖 Learn about **CPU frequency scaling** (governors like `ondemand`, `performance`, etc.).
5. 📖 Study **memory management** in Linux (paging, swapping, hugepages).
6. 📖 Explore **I/O scheduling** algorithms (`cfq`, `noop`, `bfq`, etc.).
7. 📖 Understand **power management** mechanisms (`cpufreq`, `powertop`, `turbostat`).

### **Phase 2: Implementing Basic Kernel Optimization Tools**
8. 🛠️ Develop a **uv-based kernel tuning tool** to tweak sysctl parameters dynamically.
9. 🛠️ Create a **CPU governor switching script using uv** for real-time optimization.
10. 🛠️ Implement a **simple I/O scheduler tuner using uv** for workload-based adjustments.

### **Phase 3: AI-Based Optimization & Data Collection**
11. 🧠 Build a **uv-based data collection system** to monitor system performance.
12. 🧠 Implement **machine learning models** to find optimal kernel parameters.
13. 🧠 Train models to adjust **scheduler behavior** dynamically.

### **Phase 4: Full Integration & Testing**
14. 🔥 Develop a **uv-based daemon service** to run optimizations in real-time.
15. 🔥 Implement a **uv-based configuration interface** for user-defined tuning.
16. 🔥 Test on **various Linux distributions** and optimize compatibility.
